# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: |
  User wants real authentication with user data stored in Google Sheets or Sheetly.
  Requirements:
  - Google Sheets API for storage
  - Email & Password authentication with proper validation
  - Store ONLY user data in Google Sheets, keep posts/tribes/messages in MongoDB
  - Use test/demo setup first (not requiring real Google Sheets credentials)
  - User data should create unique IDs for each user

          Created sheets_db.py module with demo mode support.
          Features:
          - SheetsDB class that supports both real Google Sheets and in-memory demo mode
          - CRUD operations: create_user, find_user_by_email, find_user_by_id, verify_password, update_user
          - Password hashing with bcrypt
          - UUID generation for user IDs
          - Demo mode initialized with test user (email: demo@loopync.com, password: password123)
      - working: true

      Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing
      
      I have implemented real authentication with the following features:
      
      1. Google Sheets Integration (Demo Mode):
         - Created sheets_db.py module with full CRUD operations
         - Currently running in demo/test mode (no real Google Sheets credentials needed)
         - In-memory storage with demo user pre-populated
         
      2. Backend Authentication:
         - JWT token-based authentication
         - Email & password login/signup
         - Password hashing with bcrypt
         - User data stored in Google Sheets (demo mode)
         - App data (posts, tribes, etc.) still in MongoDB
         
      3. Frontend Updates:
         - Auth page now has email field
         - Demo login button with credentials displayed
         - Proper validation
      
      Test Scenarios to Focus On:
      1. Demo Login: Use email "demo@loopync.com" and password "password123"
      2. New User Signup: Create account with email, handle, name, password
      3. Login with new account credentials
      4. Verify JWT token is returned and stored
      5. Test protected routes work with token
      6. Test invalid credentials fail appropriately
      
      Demo Mode Details:
      - Backend logs show "Running in DEMO MODE - using in-memory storage"
      - Pre-populated demo user available for immediate testing
      - No Google Sheets credentials required for testing
      - Can upgrade to real Google Sheets by setting GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS and GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID environment variables
