# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: |
  User wants real authentication with user data stored in Google Sheets or Sheetly.
  Requirements:
  - Google Sheets API for storage
  - Email & Password authentication with proper validation
  - Store ONLY user data in Google Sheets, keep posts/tribes/messages in MongoDB
  - Use test/demo setup first (not requiring real Google Sheets credentials)
  - User data should create unique IDs for each user

          BOOKMYSHOW-STYLE TICKET BOOKING FLOW TESTING - CRITICAL NAVIGATION ISSUES
          
          ✅ WORKING COMPONENTS:
          - Demo login successful (demo@loopync.com / password123)
          - Events page accessible via Discover > Events tab
          - Event display components working perfectly:
            * Event banner image with TechCrunch Disrupt Mumbai
            * Date (2025-11-15), Location (BKC, Mumbai), Vibe meter (92%)
            * "Get Tickets" button present and styled correctly
          - Mobile responsive design (393x852 viewport)
          - Backend API endpoints working (/api/events)
          
          ❌ CRITICAL BOOKING FLOW BLOCKERS:
          1. **Event Detail Navigation Broken**: 
             - Clicking event cards does NOT navigate to EventDetail.js page
             - "Get Tickets" button shows toast "Ticket booking will be available soon!" instead of navigating
             - Direct navigation to /events/e1 redirects to auth page (routing issue)
          
          2. **Complete Booking Flow Inaccessible**:
             - Cannot access EventDetail.js page (which has all BookMyShow components implemented)
             - Cannot test seat selection UI (theater-style grid A-J, seats 1-12)
             - Cannot test tier selection (General, VIP) and quantity selector
             - Cannot test payment flow (UPI, Card, Loop Credits)
             - Cannot test success page with QR code and credits reward
          
          📋 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
          - EventDetail.js: ✅ Complete BookMyShow-style components implemented but inaccessible
          - Payment.js: ✅ Complete payment flow with QR code generation implemented
          - Events.js: ❌ handleBookTicket() shows toast instead of navigating
          
          🔧 ROOT CAUSE: Authentication routing + Events.js navigation logic prevents booking flow access
      - working: false

          COMPREHENSIVE BOOKMYSHOW FLOW TESTING COMPLETED - DETAILED ANALYSIS
          
          🔍 TESTING METHODOLOGY:
          - Tested on both desktop (1920x1080) and mobile (393x852) viewports
          - Used demo credentials (demo@loopync.com / password123)
          - Tested multiple navigation paths and authentication scenarios
          - Verified backend API functionality independently
          
          ✅ CONFIRMED WORKING FEATURES:
          1. **Authentication System**: Login working, tokens stored correctly
          2. **Discover Page Events Tab**: 
             - TechCrunch Disrupt Mumbai event displays correctly
             - Event banner image, date (2025-11-15), location (BKC, Mumbai)
             - Vibe meter (92%) functioning
             - "Get Tickets" button present and styled
          3. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Perfect display at 393x852 viewport
          4. **Backend Integration**: All API endpoints (/api/events, /api/auth) working
          5. **Event Components**: All BookMyShow-style components implemented in EventDetail.js
          
          ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
          1. **Authentication Routing Bug**: 
             - Direct navigation to /events redirects to /auth even with valid tokens
             - Affects standalone page access while Discover tabs work fine
             - localStorage contains valid JWT tokens but routing context fails
          
          2. **Event Navigation Broken**:
             - "Get Tickets" buttons in Discover Events tab don't navigate to EventDetail
             - Event cards don't navigate to individual event pages
             - handleBookTicket() function likely shows toast instead of navigation
          
          3. **Complete Booking Flow Inaccessible**:
             - Cannot reach EventDetail.js page to test:
               * Theater-style seat selection (rows A-J, seats 1-12)
               * Tier selection (General ₹5000, VIP options)
               * Quantity selector (+/- buttons)
               * Seat status colors (Available, Selected, Booked)
               * "Proceed to Payment" functionality
             - Cannot reach Payment.js page to test:
               * Booking summary with event details
               * Payment methods (UPI, Card, Loop Credits)
               * Payment processing (2-second animation)
               * Success page with QR code generation
               * "+20 Loop Credits earned" reward system
          
          📱 MOBILE TESTING RESULTS:
          - ✅ Mobile login and authentication working
          - ✅ Mobile Discover page and Events tab functional
          - ✅ Mobile event display components working
          - ❌ Same navigation issues persist on mobile
          - ✅ Touch-friendly interface elements verified
          
          🔧 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
          1. Authentication context issue in App.js routing
          2. Events.js handleBookTicket() function not implementing navigation
          3. Protected route configuration preventing direct access to /events/:eventId
          
          📋 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
          - EventDetail.js: ✅ COMPLETE (theater seats, tiers, payment navigation)
          - Payment.js: ✅ COMPLETE (booking summary, payment methods, QR codes)
          - Events.js: ❌ NAVIGATION BROKEN (shows toast instead of routing)
          - App.js: ❌ ROUTING ISSUE (authentication context problem)
          
          🚨 URGENT FIXES NEEDED:
          1. Fix authentication routing for direct /events access
          2. Update Events.js handleBookTicket() to navigate to EventDetail
          3. Ensure event card clicks navigate to /events/:eventId
          
          The complete BookMyShow-style booking flow is implemented but inaccessible due to navigation issues.

          STANDALONE VENUES PAGE TESTING - AUTHENTICATION ROUTING ISSUE
          
          ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: Direct navigation to /venues redirects to auth page
          - URL navigation: /venues → /auth (authentication context issue)
          - Page exists and is implemented but not accessible directly
          - Authentication tokens are present in localStorage but routing fails
          
          FEATURES IMPLEMENTED (visible in code):
          - Search bar for venues and locations
          - Category filters (All, Cafés, Restaurants, Pubs & Bars, Temples, Malls, Parks)
          - Venue cards with images, ratings, locations
          - "View Menu" and "Book Table" buttons
          - Mobile-responsive design
          
          ROOT CAUSE: Authentication context or protected route configuration issue
          preventing direct access to standalone pages while allowing access via Discover tabs.

          ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: Direct navigation to /events redirects to auth page
          - URL navigation: /events → /auth (authentication context issue)
          - Page exists and is implemented but not accessible directly
          - Authentication tokens are present in localStorage but routing fails
          
          FEATURES IMPLEMENTED (visible in code):
          - Tabs (All Events, Trending, Upcoming)
          - Event cards with images, dates, locations, prices
          - "Book Tickets" button functionality
          - Mobile-responsive design
          
          ROOT CAUSE: Same authentication context issue as Venues page.
          Direct navigation to standalone pages fails while Discover tab access works.

      Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing
      
      I have implemented real authentication with the following features:
      
      1. Google Sheets Integration (Demo Mode):
         - Created sheets_db.py module with full CRUD operations
         - Currently running in demo/test mode (no real Google Sheets credentials needed)
         - In-memory storage with demo user pre-populated
         
      2. Backend Authentication:
         - JWT token-based authentication
         - Email & password login/signup
         - Password hashing with bcrypt
         - User data stored in Google Sheets (demo mode)
         - App data (posts, tribes, etc.) still in MongoDB
         
      3. Frontend Updates:
         - Auth page now has email field
         - Demo login button with credentials displayed
         - Proper validation
      
      Test Scenarios to Focus On:
      1. Demo Login: Use email "demo@loopync.com" and password "password123"
      2. New User Signup: Create account with email, handle, name, password
      3. Login with new account credentials
      4. Verify JWT token is returned and stored
      5. Test protected routes work with token
      6. Test invalid credentials fail appropriately
      
      Demo Mode Details:
      - Backend logs show "Running in DEMO MODE - using in-memory storage"
      - Pre-populated demo user available for immediate testing
      - No Google Sheets credentials required for testing
      - Can upgrade to real Google Sheets by setting GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS and GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID environment variables

      🎯 VENUES AND EVENTS PAGES TESTING COMPLETE - MIXED RESULTS
      
      COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED for newly added Venues and Events functionality:
      
      ✅ WORKING FEATURES:
      - Demo login successful (demo@loopync.com / password123)
      - Discover page accessible via bottom navigation
      - Venues tab in Discover working with venue cards, ratings, "View Menu" buttons
      - Events tab in Discover working with event cards, dates, "Get Tickets" buttons
      - Venue card navigation to detail pages working (/venues/v2)
      - Mobile viewport (393x852) display perfect
      - All UI elements properly styled and responsive
      
      ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:
      1. **Authentication Routing Problem**: Direct navigation to /venues and /events redirects to auth page
         - Tokens exist in localStorage but routing context fails
         - Affects standalone page access while Discover tabs work fine
      
      2. **Missing Category Cards**: Review request expected "Nearby Venues" and "Events & Tickets" category cards
         - Current implementation uses tabs within Discover page instead
         - No direct navigation cards to standalone pages as requested
      
      3. **Event Card Navigation**: Event cards don't navigate to detail pages (stay on discover)
      
      SCREENSHOTS CAPTURED:
      📸 Updated Discover page with working tabs
      📸 Venues tab showing venue cards and functionality  
      📸 Events tab showing event cards and functionality

      🎫 BOOKMYSHOW-STYLE TICKET BOOKING FLOW TESTING COMPLETE - CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND
      
      COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED for BookMyShow-style ticket booking flow:
      
      ✅ WORKING COMPONENTS:
      - Demo login successful (demo@loopync.com / password123)
      - Events page accessible via Discover > Events tab
      - Event display working perfectly:
        * Event banner image ✅
        * Event name (TechCrunch Disrupt Mumbai) ✅
        * Date (2025-11-15) ✅
        * Location (BKC, Mumbai) ✅
        * Vibe meter (92%) ✅
        * "Get Tickets" button ✅
      - Mobile responsive design (393x852 viewport) ✅
      - Backend API endpoints working (/api/events) ✅
      
      ❌ CRITICAL BOOKING FLOW ISSUES:
      1. **Event Detail Navigation Broken**: 
         - Clicking event cards does NOT navigate to EventDetail.js page
         - "Get Tickets" button shows toast "Ticket booking will be available soon!" instead of navigating
         - Direct navigation to /events/e1 redirects to auth page (routing issue)
      
      2. **Complete Booking Flow Inaccessible**:
         - Cannot access EventDetail.js page (which has all BookMyShow components implemented)
         - Cannot test seat selection UI (theater-style grid A-J, seats 1-12)
         - Cannot test tier selection (General, VIP)
         - Cannot test quantity selector (+/- buttons)
         - Cannot test payment flow (UPI, Card, Loop Credits)
         - Cannot test success page with QR code
      
      3. **Authentication Context Issue**:
         - Same routing problem affects both /events and /venues standalone pages
         - Works through Discover tabs but not direct navigation
         - JWT tokens present but routing context fails
      
      📋 WHAT'S IMPLEMENTED BUT NOT ACCESSIBLE:
      - EventDetail.js has complete BookMyShow-style components:
        * Theater-style seat selection (rows A-J, seats 1-12)
        * Screen indicator
        * Seat status colors (Available, Selected, Booked)
        * Legend showing seat statuses
        * Tier selection with pricing
        * Quantity selector
      - Payment.js has complete payment flow:
        * Booking summary
        * Payment methods (UPI, Card, Loop Credits)
        * Success page with QR code
        * Credits reward system
      
      🔧 ROOT CAUSE: 
      Events.js handleBookTicket() function shows toast instead of navigating to EventDetail.js
      Authentication routing prevents direct access to /events/:eventId
      
      MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS: ✅ Perfect at 393x852 viewport
      BACKEND INTEGRATION: ✅ All APIs working correctly
      
      **URGENT RECOMMENDATION**: Fix event card navigation and authentication routing to enable complete BookMyShow-style booking flow testing.

         - Proper spacing and layout optimization
         - Bottom navigation working correctly

         - Event cards displaying with proper information
         - "Get Tickets" buttons present and styled
         - Tab switching working smoothly
      
      ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES PREVENTING COMPLETE FLOW:
      
      1. **Authentication Routing Bug**:
         - Direct navigation to /events redirects to /auth
         - Valid JWT tokens present but routing context fails
         - Affects standalone page access while Discover tabs work
         - Same issue affects /venues and other protected routes
      
      2. **Event Navigation Broken**:
         - "Get Tickets" buttons don't navigate to EventDetail pages
         - Event cards don't respond to clicks for navigation
         - handleBookTicket() function likely shows toast instead of routing
         - No access to individual event detail pages
      
      3. **Complete Booking Flow Inaccessible**:
         Cannot test the following implemented features:
         
         **EventDetail.js Components** (✅ Implemented but ❌ Inaccessible):
         - Theater-style seat selection grid (10 rows A-J, 12 seats per row)
         - Screen indicator ("Screen this way")
         - Seat status colors (Available: gray, Selected: green, Booked: dark gray)
         - Seat selection legend
         - Tier selection (General ₹5000, VIP options)
         - Quantity selector with +/- buttons (max 10 tickets)
         - "Select Seats" button functionality
         - Selected seats summary display
         - Total amount calculation (quantity × tier price)
         - "Proceed to Payment" button with amount display
         
         **Payment.js Components** (✅ Implemented but ❌ Inaccessible):
         - Booking summary with event image and details
         - Selected seats display (e.g., D5, D6, D7)
         - Ticket count and total amount
         - Payment method selection (UPI, Debit/Credit Card, Loop Credits)
         - Payment method UI with icons and descriptions
         - "Pay ₹15000" button functionality
         - 2-second processing animation
         - Success page with "Booking Confirmed!" message
         - Green checkmark animation
         - Booking ID generation and display
         - QR code generation for venue entry
         - "+20 Loop Credits earned!" reward notification
         - "View My Tickets" and "Browse More Events" buttons
      
      🔧 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
      
      1. **App.js Authentication Context**: 
         - isAuthenticated state not properly synchronized
         - Protected route guards redirecting valid users
         - Token validation logic may have timing issues
      
      2. **Events.js Navigation Logic**:
         - handleBookTicket() function not implementing navigation
         - Event card onClick handlers not routing to EventDetail
         - Missing navigation to /events/:eventId paths
      
      3. **Route Protection Configuration**:
         - Overly restrictive route guards
         - Authentication state not persisting across navigation
         - Context provider not properly wrapping protected routes
      
      📋 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS SUMMARY:
      - ✅ EventDetail.js: COMPLETE BookMyShow-style implementation
      - ✅ Payment.js: COMPLETE payment flow with QR codes
      - ❌ Events.js: Navigation broken (shows toast instead of routing)
      - ❌ App.js: Authentication routing issues
      - ✅ Backend APIs: All endpoints working correctly
      - ✅ Mobile UI: Perfect responsiveness verified
      
      🚨 URGENT FIXES REQUIRED:
      1. Fix authentication context in App.js for protected routes
      2. Update Events.js handleBookTicket() to navigate to EventDetail
      3. Ensure event card clicks route to /events/:eventId
      4. Test complete flow: Events → EventDetail → Seat Selection → Payment → Success
      
      💡 RECOMMENDATION:
      The BookMyShow-style booking system is fully implemented and ready. Only navigation fixes are needed to enable the complete user journey from event discovery to ticket confirmation with QR codes.

          When fetching posts of a user, normalize media to full URL when it starts with /uploads; keep external and /api/uploads intact.

          Threads now from /api/dm/threads; messages from /api/dm/threads/:id/messages; send via /api/dm/threads/:id/messages; media upload uses /api/upload and passes /api/uploads URL. Fixed broken useEffect and missing imports. Auto-open thread via URL param.

      Debug phase started (media posts, friend requests, DMs). Implemented static upload serving under /api/uploads, prefixed media URLs on frontend, rewired Messenger to DM API, and ensured accept friend request auto-creates a DM thread. Ready for backend testing focusing on: uploads, friend request flow, DM threads/messages.
