The AI engineer systematically developed the Loopync application from an initial MVP state, adding significant features and addressing critical bugs across the full stack. The work commenced with stabilizing core authentication and data loading, followed by making the Wallet section fully functional with QR codes and payments. A major focus was the development of Vibe Rooms, evolving from basic chat to a Clubhouse-style real-time audio platform using Daily.co, including stage management and invitations. User profiles were enhanced with follower/following displays and comprehensive Instagram-style settings. The engineer also implemented a robust authentication system with email verification and password reset. The process involved iterative bug fixing (e.g., clipboard API, auth errors, Daily.co connectivity), comprehensive testing, and responding to detailed user requests. The latest work focused on resolving persistent Daily.co audio connection issues in VibeRooms, demonstrating a commitment to full feature functionality.

Loopync is envisioned as India’s Free-Speech Social × Vibe Video × Venues × Fintech Superapp with a neon glass/cyber-aurora theme. It aims to integrate social networking, e-commerce, communication, and fintech functionalities. Key features include a dynamic Timeline, VibeZone (short videos), Tribes, a LoopPay Wallet with QR codes and end-to-end payments, real-time Messenger (WebSockets), Notifications (including friend and room requests), and comprehensive Search. User authentication transitioned from Google Sheets to a robust email/username + password system with JWT. Event ticketing, post deletion, friend requests, and an enhanced onboarding flow are present. Unique social elements like Vibe Score, Streak Counter, Mood Selector, Live Activity Feed, and enhanced PostCard reactions are integrated.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical issue reported by the user: Failed to connect to audio within the VibeRooms feature, accompanied by a screenshot. This indicates a persistent problem with the Daily.co audio integration, despite previous attempts to make VibeRooms fully functional and Clubhouse-style. The previous engineer had already confirmed that the Daily.co API key was valid and backend tests for Daily.co integration had passed, suggesting the issue might be on the frontend or a more subtle configuration problem. The current task is to specifically fix this audio connection failure and ensure the VibeRooms work full fledged as a Clubhouse clone. This involves deep debugging of the Daily.co client-side integration within the  (or ) component and potentially re-evaluating the backend's room creation and token generation logic to ensure a stable audio connection.
