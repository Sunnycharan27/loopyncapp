The AI engineer's work spanned multiple critical areas of the Loopync application, demonstrating an iterative problem-solving approach. Initially, efforts focused on resolving fundamental authentication and friend-calling issues, involving debugging , , and . Key fixes included implementing robust friend-status checks, auto-assigning friends for demo users, and correcting API endpoints (e.g., DM thread creation). Subsequent tasks addressed UI/UX issues, such as making Vibe Capsules (stories) and their upload modals visible using React Portals and z-index adjustments. A major integration involved replacing the existing calling system with Agora.io, requiring extensive backend changes for token generation and frontend modifications for  and  to achieve a WhatsApp-like experience. The engineer also refined the friend request system to ensure persistence and fixed various backend API inconsistencies (messaging, comments, events). Most recently, the focus shifted to enhancing social media features, including displaying friend lists on profiles and preparing the backend for Instagram/TikTok/Twitter-like functionalities, while ensuring overall system stability for an investor demo. Repeated debugging loops, often due to cached frontend states or subtle backend inconsistencies, were a recurring challenge, resolved through systematic checks and agent assistance.

<product_requirements>
Loopync is envisioned as a Superapp integrating social, e-commerce, communication, and fintech functionalities. Recent development phases have focused on:
1.  **Authentication & User Accounts:** Implementing permanent user accounts, removing demo accounts, and ensuring robust login/signup flows with phone number integration and forgot password functionality.
2.  **Social & Communication (Full Stack v1):** Building a comprehensive friend graph, 1:1 text/image/voice messaging, 1:1 audio/video calls (initially WebRTC, then Agora.io), presence, read receipts, and push notifications. This includes fixing friend status checks, call initiation flows, and making friendships permanent.
3.  **Content Sharing (Vibe Capsules):** Implementing 24-hour stories with Cloudinary uploads, MongoDB TTL, and Redis, ensuring visibility and proper upload modal functionality.
4.  **Profile Enhancements:** Redesigning profiles to display friend counts and lists, and ensuring post author information (username, avatar) is correctly rendered.
5.  **Location-Based Services (Venues):** Categorizing venues (cafes, temples, pubs, etc.) and displaying tailored information (timings, More Information button) instead of generic menus.
6.  **Core API Stability:** Fixing various backend API endpoints (DM threads, post comments, event creation) and ensuring a clean database for demonstration.
7.  **Future Social Media Features:** Expanding beyond current functionalities to integrate Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter-like features, excluding VibeRooms.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was actively working on transforming Loopync into a comprehensive social media application, specifically focusing on integrating Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter-like features. The user explicitly requested to implement all the things except VibeRooms, which was confirmed to be working.

The work currently involves:
1.  **Profile Enhancements:** The engineer started by fixing the profile () to display friends count and a dedicated Friends tab showing the actual friend list. A  component was created for this.
2.  **Post Display:** The engineer verified that  already uses  and , confirming that the frontend is ready to display author information provided by the backend. The backend's  endpoint was confirmed to enrich posts with author data.
3.  **Stories Visibility:** The  component was checked, and its  prop was confirmed to handle refreshing stories after upload.
4.  **Backend Social Media Endpoints:** The engineer created  and subsequently added new social media endpoints to  after the existing post-related endpoints. These new endpoints are intended to support the expanded Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter-like features.

The very last action taken was restarting the backend to apply these newly added social media feature endpoints in . The system health was previously reported at 77.4% before initiating these new social media feature additions.
