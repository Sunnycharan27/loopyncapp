The AI engineer has progressed Loopync, a full-stack social superapp, from an MVP. Initial efforts included fixing MongoDB serialization and integrating Cloudinary for media, and Razorpay for payments. Key tasks completed include implementing Google Sheets-based user authentication and ensuring MongoDB user creation upon login. The LoopPay Wallet was redesigned to a Starbucks-style interface. A BookMyShow-style ticket booking system, including event details, seat selection, payment, and QR ticket generation, was successfully integrated and tested. Recent work focused on fixing critical frontend issues like post media not displaying (due to incorrect API proxy URL generation) and onboarding preference saving. Additionally, a post deletion feature, a friend request system, and notification routes were added, along with navigation improvements. The trajectory concludes with the user providing an extensive new Product Requirements Document, and the AI engineer seeking clarification on the expanded scope.

<product_requirements>
Loopync is India’s Free-Speech Social × Vibe Video × Venues × Fintech Superapp, a mobile-first (iPhone 15) and desktop web application with a neon glass/cyber-aurora theme. Core features include Timeline (posts), VibeZone (reels), Tribes (groups), LoopPay Wallet (UPI, balance, history), Venues (QR, menu, split bill), Events/Ticketing (QR pass), Creator Marketplace, Messenger (DMs, spaces), Discover/Search, and user profiles/settings. Compliance (India-specific badges, DPDP Consent Center) and mock AI features (Parallels AI, Safety AI, Sculpture AI) are also required. Integrations with Cloudinary and Razorpay are essential. The current build includes functional Timeline, VibeZone, Tribes, a Starbucks-style LoopPay wallet, Messenger, Discover, Notifications, and Search pages. Recent additions include Google Sheets-based authentication, a BookMyShow-style event ticketing system with QR codes, post deletion, and a friend request system. The overall goal is to create a fully functional, production-ready social media platform.
