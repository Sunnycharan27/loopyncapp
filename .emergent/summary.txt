The AI engineer has significantly evolved Loopync, a full-stack social superapp. Initially, the focus was on core MVP features, including Google Sheets-based authentication, Cloudinary and Razorpay integrations, a Starbucks-style wallet, and a BookMyShow-like ticketing system. Recent work addressed critical frontend bugs like post media display and onboarding preference saving, while adding post deletion, a friend request system, and notification routes. A major pivot occurred when the user provided an extensive PRD, suggesting a tech stack migration. However, the user opted to adapt new features to the existing FastAPI, MongoDB, React stack. Consequently, the engineer implemented an enhanced onboarding flow with mock eKYC and DPDP consent, fixed a critical double login issue, and built a real-time friend request and messaging system using WebSockets. Username uniqueness validation was added to signup, and numerous unique features like Vibe Score, Live Activity Feed, and Post Reactions were integrated. Debugging primarily focused on frontend JSX errors and correctly mounting the WebSocket server. The trajectory concludes with the user reporting issues with media posts, friend requests, and chats not displaying, prompting the engineer to begin debugging and further enhancing the Messenger and user profile views.

Loopync aims to be India’s Free-Speech Social × Vibe Video × Venues × Fintech Superapp, a mobile-first (iPhone 15) and desktop web application with a neon glass/cyber-aurora theme. Core features include Timeline (posts), VibeZone (reels), Tribes (groups), LoopPay Wallet, Venues (QR, menu, split bill), Events/Ticketing (QR pass), Creator Marketplace, Messenger (DMs, spaces), Discover/Search, user profiles/settings. It also requires India-specific compliance (badges, DPDP Consent Center) and mock AI features (Parallels AI, Safety AI, Sculpture AI). Cloudinary and Razorpay integrations are essential.

**Implementation Done So Far:**
Functional Timeline, VibeZone, Tribes, Starbucks-style LoopPay wallet, Messenger, Discover, Notifications, and Search pages are present. Google Sheets-based authentication, a BookMyShow-style event ticketing system with QR codes, post deletion, and a friend request system are implemented. The onboarding flow was enhanced with Aadhaar eKYC (mock) and DPDP Consent. Real-time friend requests and messaging are being implemented, along with a search bar on the Discover page, and unique social features like Vibe Score, Streak Counter, Mood Selector, Live Activity Feed, and enhanced PostCard reactions. Username uniqueness validation for signup is also implemented.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a critical bug reported by the user regarding posts with media, friend requests, and chats/DMs not being visible, along with additional feature requests for profile viewing from search and search within Messenger.

**Specifically:**
1.  **Posts with Media:** Backend API for posts () showed data was present, indicating a frontend rendering issue likely related to media URLs.
2.  **User Profile Page:** A new React component  was created to allow users to view other user profiles. The corresponding route was added to .
    
3.  **Discover Search Navigation:** The search functionality on the  page was updated to navigate to the new  page when a user result is clicked.
4.  **Messenger Enhancements:** The  component was being updated to utilize the newly implemented DM API, and to include search functionality for conversations. The existing polling mechanism for messages was being adapted to the new real-time WebSocket infrastructure.

The engineer had just finished updating Messenger to use the new DM API and was about to provide a comprehensive summary, implying this was the current focus and immediate next step.
