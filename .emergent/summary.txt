The AI engineer systematically evolved the Loopync application. Initially, a critical Failed to connect to audio bug in VibeRooms, powered by Daily.co, was addressed by implementing token-based authentication and then completely replacing Daily.co with Agora.io, including installing SDKs, updating backend logic, and fixing a UID generation error. Subsequently, the VibeZone was transformed into an Instagram Reels clone, incorporating sharing, comments, music, and robust video error handling. A universal sharing system (both link-based and in-app friend sharing) was then implemented across all content types (posts, reels, rooms, events), requiring frontend integration and a new backend notification endpoint. A comprehensive friend request and acceptance system was built. Authentication was streamlined by removing email verification and introducing instant login after signup, with thorough backend testing. Vibe Rooms were removed from the Messenger section, which was then redeveloped to feature Trust Circles, including fixing a build-breaking syntax error. The latest work involves initiating the Parallels AI Engine feature (starting with Find Your Parallel UI placeholder) and updating venue seed data to be Hyderabad-specific.

<product_requirements>
Loopync is a Superapp envisioned with a neon theme, integrating social networking, e-commerce, communication, and fintech. Key features include a dynamic Timeline, VibeZone (short videos), Tribes, LoopPay Wallet (QR, payments), real-time Messenger, Notifications, and Search, all underpinned by robust email/password authentication. Recently implemented: a Clubhouse-style VibeRooms (now powered by Agora.io, with stage management and invites); enhanced Profile pages (wallet, settings, tickets, followers); Instagram-style User Settings; generic Sharing (external links & in-app friend sharing); Comments on posts/reels; and dark/light theming. Vibe Rooms in Messenger were replaced by a fully functional Trust Circles feature. The user explicitly requested an Find Your Parallel AI feature in Discover for personalized feeds and recommendations, and to update venues with Hyderabad-specific data (temples, pubs, events).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing the user's request to populate venues, temples, pubs, and events with **Hyderabad-specific data**. This involved modifying the backend  file to replace existing seed data with the new location-specific information. The last action performed was initiating a backend service restart to apply these changes. This task is part of a broader user request that also includes implementing a new Find Your Parallel AI feature, for which a frontend component () has been created and integrated into the  page as a placeholder. The current work specifically ensures the application's venue data reflects its Hyderabad roots.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Verify that the Hyderabad-specific venue, temple, pub, and event data is correctly loaded and displayed in the application.
