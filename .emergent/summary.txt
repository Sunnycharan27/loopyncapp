The AI engineer has been incrementally developing Loopync, a full-stack social superapp (FastAPI, React, MongoDB). Initial development focused on core MVP features like authentication, wallet, and ticketing. The trajectory shows a transition to addressing critical bugs related to media display, friend requests, and messaging, alongside integrating new features like a user profile page, Messenger search, AI quick actions (using Emergent LLM), and guided tours. A mock JioSaavn music library was also integrated into VibeZone. The engineer consistently communicated progress, confirmed plans, and debugged issues based on user feedback. Recurring themes include resolving frontend rendering issues, backend API data handling, and ensuring real-time features via WebSockets. The trajectory concludes with the engineer having applied a series of fixes in response to the user's general request to fix all the errors and issues and make it ready to deploy due to a lack of application preview.

Loopync is envisioned as India’s Free-Speech Social × Vibe Video × Venues × Fintech Superapp for mobile and desktop, featuring a neon glass/cyber-aurora theme. Key functionalities include:
-   **Core Social:** Timeline (posts with photos/videos), VibeZone (short videos/reels like TikTok), Tribes (groups), Friend requests, follows, and search.
-   **Commerce/Fintech:** LoopPay Wallet (Starbucks-style), Venues (QR, menu, split bill), Events/Ticketing (BookMyShow-style with QR pass), Creator Marketplace.
-   **Communication:** Messenger (DMs, spaces, real-time), Notifications.
-   **User Experience:** User profiles/settings, Discover/Search, persistent login sessions, email/username + password authentication with JWT.
-   **India-Specific Compliance:** Aadhaar eKYC (mock), DPDP Consent Center.
-   **AI Features (Mock):** Parallels AI (feed ranking), Safety AI, Sculpture AI (analytics).
-   **Integrations:** Cloudinary (media), Razorpay (payments), Google Sheets (initial auth), Emergent LLM key (for AI).

**Implementation Done So Far:**
Functional Timeline, VibeZone, Tribes, LoopPay wallet, Messenger, Discover, Notifications, and Search pages are present. Google Sheets-based authentication was used initially, now email/username + password. A BookMyShow-style event ticketing system with QR codes, post deletion, and a friend request system are implemented. The onboarding flow was enhanced with mock Aadhaar eKYC and DPDP Consent. Real-time friend requests and messaging are active via WebSockets. A search bar on the Discover page (navigating to UserProfile.js) and unique social features like Vibe Score, Streak Counter, Mood Selector, Live Activity Feed, and enhanced PostCard reactions are integrated. Username uniqueness validation for signup is also implemented. Messenger search UI, AI Quick Actions, Guided Demo Tours, and a mock JioSaavn music library integration for VibeZone have also been added. Core bugs related to media visibility, friend requests, and DM functionality have been debugged and fixed.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was comprehensively addressing user-reported issues and preparing the application for deployment. The user's explicit instruction was to fix all the errors and issues and make it ready to deploy here i cant see the preview of the whole application.

The AI engineer focused on verifying and rectifying several critical functionalities:
1.  **VibeZone Video Uploads and Playback:** Ensured that uploaded videos are correctly processed, stored with playable URLs (), and are immediately visible and autoplaying in the ReelViewer component () without needing a page refresh. This involved normalizing video URLs.
2.  **Messenger Messaging Flow:** Addressed the core problem of messages not sending or receiving reliably. This involved:
    -   Updating the backend DM send API to accept a JSON body payload for better validation and reliability ().
    -   Enhancing the frontend Messenger component () with logic to auto-create DM threads if they don't exist upon message send, and to provide more precise error feedback.
    -   Improving WebSocket environment handling for consistent backend URL usage within .
3.  **Guided Tours UI:** As per user request (Chat Message 322: also remove start user tour and start power user tour thing), the launchers for the New User Tour and Power User Tour were removed from the Home page (). The  component itself remains in the codebase but is not actively displayed.
4.  **Application Preview/Deployment Readiness:** The engineer addressed a previous warning from the Deployer Agent regarding a hardcoded share URL by replacing it with a dynamic  in .
5.  **Final Verification:** The engineer performed a backend API smoke test covering reels, posts, friend/DM flow, and music search, reporting all endpoints responded as expected.

The final state of work is that the engineer has applied these fixes and informed the user that the application should now be ready for go-live and encouraged the user to refresh the preview and try the major features to verify if everything works smoothly.

<optional_next_step>
Based on the previous interaction, the next step is to get user confirmation on the implemented fixes and proceed with full frontend automated tests or deployment.
